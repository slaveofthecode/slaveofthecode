### Hi there 👋

This is my modest Github account. I don't often upload code, but I try to show part of all my skills 😏😎.

Some of my last... updates code.

- [mern-ql](https://github.com/slaveofthecode/mern-ql) 
  This is an example (simple), where I used the famous stack tech Mongo, Express, React, and Node, but in my case, I added GraphQL (for that in the end I put on "-ql" 😉).
  You can see on this repository, different branch which has different versions of the project.

- [adventjs](https://github.com/slaveofthecode/adventjs)
  Here you can see a list of challengers separated for different years since 2021 of the [website](https://adventjs.dev/) of @midudev
  I'd like to show you my solutions to these challenges.

- [styles](https://github.com/slaveofthecode/styles)
  In this awesome repository, you will see, experiment, and test all existing code related to several examples in CSS (just CSS pure)
